# pocketfurc
PocketFurc is a discreet, light-weight Furcadia (http://www.furcadia.com) chat client written for Chrome.
As such, it runs anywhere Chrome runs.

You must have a character already registered with the game in order to log in.
You will appear wherever you last logged off with whatever colors and description you last had in-game.

PocketFurc NOT a graphical client. Some sort of visualization is planned as a long-term goal, but don't expect it to come around any time soon. Ideally, you'll have situated your character in a convenient location prior to logging in, or at least have someone to lead or summon you around.

Basic features currently include:
- Chat (speech, whisper, emotes, raw commands)
- Nearby players list.
- Interactive player names.
- HTML chat support.
- Friends list.
